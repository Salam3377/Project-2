# Project-2

   My plan is to create web app CoffeeShop. There i am going to have a menu, some information about
 coffeeShop, contactUS and user model, which is going to be able to sign up, log in/out, and where account holders can have some more options such as, order some products online, and get some extra discounts and bonuses.


User Stories: 
- create an account 
- log in
- log out
- Check through menu
- add menu items to cart
- update cart
- remove from cart


Stretch goal: 
- apply discounts
- menu item quantity(changes when added or removed from cart)

Some very Basic plan:
