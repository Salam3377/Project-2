               Coffee Shop offers a unique coffee house environment. We are not only a place to drop in and get your morning cup of coffee
            (although you are more than welcome to do that), we are a place where you can sit down and enjoy that cup of perfection.
            If you need to work, we have a seating area created specifically for you. If you need to rest, we have a soft-seating area in front of a stone fire place
            that is perfect for your mind and body. We offer a delicious variety of coffee made by our professionally trained baristas. 
            We have everything from classic coffee to our house made specialty beverages.  All of our sauces & syrups are made in-house with all natural ingredients (no chemicals or preservatives)
            ensuring you the highest quality in taste & health.  You can complete your coffee with one of our delicious desserts made by our very own baker.
            We look forward to serving you at Coffee Shop!
